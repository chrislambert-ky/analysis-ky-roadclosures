A few notes for myself about the libraries and tools I used in this project.

Since I'm unaware of who may be using this project, I should add Jupyter Lab and Notebook into my requirements.txt file.  
That will at least provide the user with all of the libraries they need to work with my notebook, if they aren't using VS Code.

A reminder on how to interact with Jupyter Notebook
    To run Jupyter Notebook classic, use "jupyter notebook"
    To run Jupyter Labs, use "jupyter lab"


When I installed Pandas, it produced a deprecation notice about pyarrow.
Since I won't know when this project will be graded, I'm going to include pyarrow as a separate pip install.
