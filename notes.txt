A few notes for myself about the libraries and tools I used in this project.

I am using Python 3.11.7
I am using VS Code with Juyter Notebook extension(s).
When I installed Pandas, it produced a deprecation notice about pyarrow.
    I am including pyarrow as a separate pip install.

I have also added Jupyter Lab and Notebook into my requirements.txt file.
That should help anyone who is not using VS Code with Jupyter extensions.

A reminder on how to interact with Jupyter Notebook
    To run Jupyter Notebook classic, use "jupyter notebook"
    To run Jupyter Labs, use "jupyter lab"
