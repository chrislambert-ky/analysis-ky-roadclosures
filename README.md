# Analysis of Road Closure Data from Kentucky

## Project Overview:
The project aims to analyze road closure data provided by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). The primary objective is to identify trends in road closures to better understand network resiliency during periods of extreme weather events.

## Technical Insight:
- **Python Libraries:** To begin the project, I will begin by utilizing VS Code, Python and Jupyter Notebook extensions, and a Python virtual environment with libraries such as pandas, pyarrow, and requests for data importing, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Sources:** Road closure data will be sourced from the Transportation Operations Center (TOC) of KYTC in CSV format.
- **Access Requirements:** No special access requirements are needed as the data is openly provided by KYTC.
- **Data Cleaning:** Standardize column names, data types (date/time), and parse/extract latitude and longitude.
- **Data Integration:** Merge/concatenate multiple data sources.
- **Optional Integration:** I may also utilize KYTC's roadway snapping API to add additional attributes to the road closures dataset.
- **Summary/Statistics:** Calculate descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of road closures by District, County, and Road Type.
- **Optional Summary/Statistics:** I may also perform an analysis by roadway elevation and/or current weather conditions if time permits.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create visualizations for exploring patterns and trends in road closure data.
- **Documentation:** Document the analysis process, including data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, and insights gained.
- **Reporting:** Prepare a report/presentation summarizing key findings, insights, and visual outputs from the analysis.
- **Optional Reporting:** If time permits, I may also utilize PowerBI or Tableau to better visualize the data.
