    "Goal: Quantify the impact of road closures based on three metrics:\n",
    "1) Total number of closures<br>\n",
    "2) Frequency of closures<br>\n",
    "3) Duration of closures.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The list below are a few sample questions that I hope to answer:<br>\n",
    "1) How many closures occur statewide each year? (Normal bar graph showing count per year?)<br>\n",
    "2) How many road closures occur in each county per year? (Normal bar graph with year as x-axis and count of closures?)<br>\n",
    "3) How often, or how frequently, is a single road being closed due to rainfall? (Horizonatal bar graph with roadname as Y axis or pivot table output?)<br>\n",
    "4) What is the average duration of road closures?\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "1) Import/load road closure data directly from hosted web server into Pandas.<br>\n",
    "2) Parse out the Latitude and Longitude by stripping unneeded hyperlink characters.<br>\n",
    "3) Produce standalone latitude and longitude columns/fields, which is preferred for mapping in most BI software.<br>\n",
    "3) Standardize timestamps to assist with calculating duration.<br>\n",
    "4) Modify the duration calculation to show hours as float64, making it easier to use in popular BI tools.<br>\n",
    "5) Summarize the results by year, county, and roadway using record counts and caculated durations.\n",
    "6) If time allows, develop an overall score that takes into consideration the frequency and duration of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "DISCLAIMER:  Results may vary.  In addition to historic data, this notebook is also utilizing current year data.  The data source is updated every 2 minutes but only when there are active road closures due to weather related events.\n",
